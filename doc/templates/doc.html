        <p class="doc-line">
            Markup is an online annotation tool that can be used to transform unstructured documents into structured <a class="doc-link" href="http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html" target="_blank">standoff format</a> for NLP and ML tasks, such as named-entity recognition. Markup learns as you annotate in order to predict and suggest complex annotations. Markup also provides integrated access to existing and custom ontologies, enabling the prediction and suggestion of ontology mappings based on the text you're annotating.

            Annotation
        </h2>
        <p class="doc-line">
            To add an annotation, you must:
            
            <ul class="doc-line doc-list">
                <li>Highlight the desired span of text within the open document.</li>
                <li>Select a desired entity.</li>
                <li>Populate or select a value from the available attributes, which have been dynamically displayed based on the chosen entity.</li>
                <li>Select an ontology term to map to. Markup automatically suggests ontology mappings based on the text you're annotating, although a direct search of the ontology can be performed via Markup if necessary.</li>
                <li>Add the annotation by pressing the <span class="doc-field">+ Annotation</span> button</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Upon adding an annotation, it will displayed both within the document text and on the annotation panel. Within the annotation panel, annotations will be grouped by their entity, and ordered based on the appearance within the document text.
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Hovering over an annotation in either the document panel or annotation panel will highlight the annotation in both panels, and will display a tooltip containing information about the annotation (e.g. attributes).
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Clicking an annotation within the annotation panel will display a dropdown that contains all information (e.g. attributes) that correspond with the annotation, along with options for editing and deleting the annotation. 
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Markup allows for unlimited annotation of a single region, thus enabling the capture of complex data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="doc-headline">
            Predictive Annotation Suggestions
        </h2>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Markup functionality includes a novel system to predict and suggest complex annotation using Active and Sequence-to-Sequence learning models.
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Upon opening or switching to a document, Markup will predict all annotations and display them in a collapsible drop-down within the annotation panel. Each annotation will be grouped and coloured based on its entity category, and ordered based on its appearance within the document text.
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Each annotation suggestion will consist of:
            <ul class="doc-line doc-list">
                <li>A span of text within the open document that will be annotated.</li>
                <li>An entity category.</li>
                <li>Populated attributes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Selecting an annotation suggestion will give the user the opportunity to review all details related to the annotation (e.g. attribute values) before accepting, editing or rejecting it, where:
            <ul class="doc-line doc-list">
                <li>Accepting will add the annotation to the document.</li>
                <li>Editing will enable the user to add, adjust, and remove attribute values prior to adding the annotation.</li>
                <li>Rejecting will remove the annotation from the suggestion list.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            The response to a suggestion from a user will feedback into the prediction models to improve future predictions. Model adjustments will only be made to the model local to the user, and thus will have no impact on predictions for other users. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="doc-headline">
            Export
        </h2>
        <p class="doc-line">
            After completing the annotation process, the user can export all anontations by selecting the <span class="doc-field">Export</span> button in the configuraton panel. Exporting the annotations will produce an annotation file, with the .ann file extension, that contains all added annotations in <a class="doc-link" href="http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html" target="_blank">standoff format</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Browsers recommend by default that annotations be saved to the local <span class="doc-field">Download</span> folder. When annotating large quantities of documents, it can be useful to update this default location, which can be done on various browsers, as shown in the following guides: <a class="doc-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/231002/how-to-change-the-chrome-download-folder-location/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a class="doc-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/260271/how-to-change-the-firefox-download-folder-location/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a class="doc-link" href="https://ccm.net/faq/10003-opera-change-the-default-folder-for-your-downloads" target="_blank">Opera</a>, <a class="doc-link" href="https://osxdaily.com/2018/07/01/change-safari-download-location-mac/" target="_blank">Safari</a>.
