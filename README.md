# Markup Annotation Tool for ML and NLP

![](https://markup-storage.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/annotate.png)

Markup is an online annotation tool that can be used to transform unstructured documents into structured formats for NLP and ML tasks, such as named-entity recognition. Markup learns as you annotate to predict and suggest complex annotations, and also provides integrated access to common and custom ontologies for concept mapping.

# Key Features

- **Predictive annotation** - Markup's machine learning-powered predictive annotation feature suggests complex annotations as you work, making the process of annotating documents more efficient and saving you valuable time.

- **Integrated ontology access** Markup provides integrated access to a wide range of common ontologies (e.g. UMLS, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10), as well as the ability to upload custom ontologies, for concept mapping.

- **Predictive ontology mapping** - Markup's predictive ontology mapping feature uses machine learning to suggest appropriate mappings to standard and custom terminologies based on the text you're annotating.

- **User-friendly interface** - Whether you're a technical expert or a beginner, Markup's user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to start annotating documents with minimal setup.
