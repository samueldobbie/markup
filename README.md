# Markup

Markup is an online annotation tool that can be used to transform unstructured documents into structured formats for NLP and ML tasks, such as named-entity recognition. Markup learns as you annotate in order to predict and suggest complex annotations. Markup also provides integrated access to common and custom ontologies, enabling the prediction and suggestion of ontology mappings based on the text you're annotating.

# Key Features

- *Predictive annotation* - Markup's machine learning-powered predictive annotation feature suggests complex annotations as you work, making the process of annotating documents a breeze and saving you valuable time.

- *Predictive ontology mapping* - Markup's predictive ontology mapping feature uses machine learning to suggest appropriate mappings to standard and custom terminologies based on the text you're annotating.

- *Integrated ontology access* - Markup provides integrated access to a wide range of common ontologies (e.g. UMLS, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10), as well as the ability to upload custom ontologies.

- *User-friendly interface* - Whether you're a technical expert or a beginner, Markup's user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to start annotating documents with minimal setup.
